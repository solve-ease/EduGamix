💡 Rethinking Gamification for WsCube
 <br>Instead of just leaderboards and points, we focused on high-impact, innovative features that provide real-world learning experiences.

🎯 Introducing Two Marketplaces

 1️⃣ Freelancing Simulator 🏗️
A marketplace like Upwork where students bid on dummy projects.
Winners work with an AI avatar acting as their client to simulate real freelancing gigs.

2️⃣ Job Simulation Hub 💼
Students apply for dummy job postings with a resume.
They go through AI-powered hiring rounds (GD, interviews, etc.).
Once hired, they join a team and work on projects collaboratively.


## Machine Learning Model Description:
<br>

### **Script 1: Bid Ranking Prediction**
Predicts freelancing bid ranks using a deep learning model for text clarity and a regression model for numerical features (experience, price, reputation). Combines both models to output a bid rank.

---

### **Script 2: Student Learning Style Clustering**
Clusters students into learning styles (e.g., visual, fast, slow learners) based on behavior data (clicks, time spent, scores). Uses K-Means clustering, PCA for visualization, and provides personalized recommendations.

---

### **Script 3: Topic Recommendation with BKT and Collaborative Filtering**
Recommends quiz topics by tracking skill mastery using Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and collaborative filtering (SVD). Adjusts recommendations based on performance and time taken, focusing on weak areas.
